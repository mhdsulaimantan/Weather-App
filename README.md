# Weather-App

### Description:
This is a small weather website that allows users to check the weather status in different regions. This is a solution for the [Odin project assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app). The project was built using JavaScript and Webpack (JS bundler).

### How it works:
1. The user can get weather details for a specific location:
    - Temperature
    - Max Temperature
    - Min Temperature
    - Feels Lile Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Wind Speed
2. The user can fetch their location's data or search for a location.
3. The user can get the data in both Celsius and Fahrenheit metrics.
4. The user can get weather data **Now** or in **3 Hours / 5 Days Forecast**.
5. **3 Hours / 5 Days Forecast**: The data can be viewed both in Table and Chart views.
